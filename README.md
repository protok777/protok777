```

Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite: server, client.

Note: This module does not work in the browser.
The client in the docs is a reference to a back end with the role of a client in the WebSocket communication.
Browser clients must use the native WebSocket object. To make the same code work seamlessly on Node.js and the browser,
 you can use one of the many wrappers available on npm, like isomorphic-ws.
